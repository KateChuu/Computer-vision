# Computer Vision Projects

## 1. Image Filtering and AR Object Rendering

- **Fourier Transform:** Applied Fourier Transform on images and analyzed the transformed magnitude images.
- **Depth Estimation:** Used the pinhole camera model to calculate the depth of objects in images.
- **Object Rendering:** Developed code to render a given object with known coordinates and height within an image.

## 2. Patch Matching with Neural Networks

- **Neural Network Training:** Trained a neural network to match keypoints between two images.
- **Network Optimisation:** Experimented with the effect of adding more convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dropout layers on both performance and efficiency.

## 3. Computing Disparity between Stereo Images

- **Disparity Estimation:** Implemented disparity estimation between stereo images.
- **Experiments:** Tested various window sizes, kernel types, and image resolutions to optimize the disparity calculation.

## 4. Physical Reasoning Challenge (Final Project)

- **Objective:** Fine-tuned a pretrained ResNet model from Hugging Face to predict the stable height of a stack of 3D shape objects.
- **Process:**
  - **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the data for training.
  - **Training and Evaluation:** Trained the model and evaluated its performance.
  - **Error Analysis:** Analyzed and discussed the model's errors and limitations in the final report.
